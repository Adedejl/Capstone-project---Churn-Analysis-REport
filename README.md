## Business problem

The Canadian bank is experiencing significant customer churn, which directly impacts revenue, profitability, and long-term customer lifetime value. However, there is a lack of clarity around the key drivers of this churn, the customer segments most at risk, and actionable strategies to retain customers. The bank needs to understand who is leaving, why they are leaving, and how to prevent it using insights from customer demographics, behavior, and engagement patterns. The business needs a data-driven approach to identify patterns, predict churn behavior, and implement effective retention strategies to reduce customer loss and enhance loyalty.

## Dataset information

The dataset used for this customer churn analysis consists of customer-level data from a Canadian bank. It includes both demographic and behavioral attributes that help identify patterns related to churn.
Key Variables in the Dataset:
- Column Name:	Description
- CustomerID:	Unique identifier for each customer
- Surname:	Customer’s last name (used for anonymized identification)
- Gender:	Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- Age:	Customer’s age
- Geography:	Customer’s province or region (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, Alberta)
- Tenure:	Number of years the customer has been with the bank
- Balance:	Current account balance
- NumOfProducts:	Number of products the customer holds (e.g., checking, savings, credit)
- HasCrCard:	Whether the customer owns a credit card (Yes/No or 1/0)
- IsActiveMember:	Whether the customer is actively engaged (Yes/No or 1/0)
- EstimatedSalary:	Estimated annual income of the customer
- Churn:	Target variable — indicates if the customer has left the bank (Yes/No or 1/0)

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns within the bank, identify key factors influencing churn, and provide data-driven insights and strategies to reduce customer attrition. By leveraging customer demographics, behavioral data, and financial indicators, the goal is to improve customer retention, increase customer lifetime value, and support strategic decision-making for the bank’s growth.

## Business Objective

Before diving into analysis, it’s critical we align with the business goals and what the users expect to see. The bank’s primary objective is to reduce customer churn by understanding why it’s happening. At the same time, business users—such as marketing and customer experience teams—need a clear and interactive dashboard that highlights churn patterns, identifies risk segments, and guides strategic action.

## Business Questions and metrics

To guide our analysis, we focused on key business questions such as: 
- What’s our churn rate?
- Who’s churning?
- Which Gender Churn the Most adn why?
- Why are they leaving?
- how can we stop it?
