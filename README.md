**Business problem**
-- The Canadian bank is experiencing significant customer churn, which directly impacts revenue, profitability, and long-term customer lifetime value. However, there is a lack of clarity around the key drivers of this churn, the customer segments most at risk, and actionable strategies to retain customers. The bank needs to understand who is leaving, why they are leaving, and how to prevent it using insights from customer demographics, behavior, and engagement patterns. The business needs a data-driven approach to identify patterns, predict churn behavior, and implement effective retention strategies to reduce customer loss and enhance loyalty.
